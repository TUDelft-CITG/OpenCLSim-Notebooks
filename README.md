Documentation can be found [here](https://oedm.vanoord.com/proxy/circleci_no_redirect/github/TUDelft-CITG/OpenCLSim/master/latest/3b00333d4fe20c813bd9bc81ce2e1d4f5fae987a/tmp/artifacts/docs/index.html).

## Example notebooks

The benefit of OpenCLSim is the generic set-up. This set-up allows the creation of complex logistical flows. A number of examples are presented in the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/OpenCLSim-Notebooks/tree/master/notebooks). You can run them locally or as an [Azure notebook](https://notebooks.azure.com/joris-denuijl/projects/openclsim/).
