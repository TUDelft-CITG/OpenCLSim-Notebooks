# OpenCLSim Notebooks

This is the repository with examples for the [OpenCLSim](https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/OpenCLSim) package. 

The package documentation can be found [here](openclsim.readthedocs.io).

## Example notebooks

The benefit of OpenCLSim is the generic set-up. This set-up allows the creation of complex logistical flows. A number of examples are presented in the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/OpenCLSim-Notebooks/tree/master/notebooks). You can run them locally or as an [Azure notebook](https://notebooks.azure.com/joris-denuijl/projects/openclsim/).

If you wish to use the notebooks on your local drive, use the following code to get started.

``` bash
# Download the package
git clone https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/OpenCLSim-Notebooks

# Go to the correct folder
cd OpenCLSim-Notebooks

# Install package
pip pip install -r requirements.txt

# Go to the notebooks foldeer
cd notebooks

# Start jupyter notebooks
jupyter notebook
```
