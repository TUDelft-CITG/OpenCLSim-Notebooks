## Example notebooks

The benefit of OpenCLSim is the generic set-up. This set-up allows the creation of complex logistical flows. A number of examples are presented in the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/OpenCLSim-Notebooks/tree/master/notebooks). You can run them locally or as an [Azure notebook](https://notebooks.azure.com/joris-denuijl/projects/openclsim/).

Check the information on how to get started either way.
